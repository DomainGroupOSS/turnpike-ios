**Easy installation:**

Cocoapods is an Objective-C library manager. It makes installing Turnpike as easy as adding one line of code to a Podfile.

To install Cocoapods: 
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup

Then, to install Turnpike with Cocoapods:
1. Create a Podfile
2. Add the following to the Podfile:
platform :ios
pod 'Turnpike', '0.0.1'
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Podfile in terminal and issue the following command:
pod install

That's it! For a more thorough tutorial on Cocoapods, see: http://www.raywenderlich.com/12139.
